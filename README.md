# MSSABuild1
A very rudimentary program for Magazine Subscription Service Agency to hasten the process of newspaper markup costs. The program prompts the user to select either a 'fixed' or 'variable' percentage function. 'Fixed' percentage asks the percentage of markup first, followed by an iterative process of prompting for the newspaper cost. The basic algorithm in calculate.cpp computes the percentage markup and displays for the user. The 'Variable' function is very similar, except the program prompts the user for the percentage markup EACH time, as the markup percentage could be different for each newspaper. 

# Program Rules
Use integers 1, 2, or 9 for each menu option. Within each functional option (cases 1 and 2), enter integer 9 to exit terminal. 

Funtional options iterate continuously until "9" is entered for manual exit of program.
